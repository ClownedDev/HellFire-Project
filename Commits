#Core/Anticheat: Implement more aggressive fly check.
#Core/Anticheat: Cleanup
#Core/Anticheat: Implemented two new checks (Freeze Z & faction hack interaction)
#Core/Anticheat: Z freeze detection is now 100% working, needs testing of the behaviour 'if player is in water'.
#Core/Anticheat: Attempt to fix the false positive for Naxxramas - It's not an actual map building, it's a wmo/m2 object so it's Z coord is down on the ground
#Fixed linux compile and some false positives with our anticheat.
#Core/Anticheat: Fixed false positives with freeze-z.
#Core/Anticheat: Fixed false positive with some zones/caves without height data (outputting -200,000.00 Z coord.)
#Core/Anticheat: Fixed another false/positive check releated to incorrect floor coordinates.
#Core/Movement: I have to rewrite targeted movement or merge with TC.
#Core/Anticheat: Fully fixed the false positive with floorZ being over 200k (no vmap data)
#Core/Movement: Creatures should NOT go trough walls/m2 objects when fleeing.
Core/Misc: Creatures should have 100% health when they reached home position.
#Core/Anticheat: Exclude Serpentshrine Cavern from our custom anticheat checks.
#Core/Movement: Some logic inside 'isInAccessiblePlaceFor...' still requires proper evade implementation for proper evade/combat mechanic
#Test for the flightmasters, should work now...
#Core/Anticheat: Fixed false-positive with transport
#Core/Misc: fixed client freezes with stealthed npcs.
#Core/Anticheat: Temp disable our custom Freeze-Z check as i have to rewrite it's logic.
